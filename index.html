          <li>JavaScript - high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
          <li>control flow - order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>array - single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>for loop - uses the predictable pattern of indices to preform a task on all the items in the array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over - contains three important statements:</li>           
             <ul>
                <li>the first statement determines the starting point for the loop ( var x = 0; )</li>
                <li>the second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable(x) is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running ( x < shapes.length; )</li>
                <li>the final statement allows the array to iterate over each item ( x++ )</li>
              </ul>
          <li>function - a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task - you have to call it by name to execute ( function helloWorld() )</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
